*OpenTracing Toolbox* is a collection of libraries that build on top of [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) and provide extensions and plugins to existing instrumentations.

- **Status**: Under development and used in production

## Features

- Legacy [FlowID](#flowid) compatibility support 
- JDBC support
- Extensible [OpenTracing Proxy](#proxy) (wrapper) w/ support for listeners and interceptors
- Servlet support
- Spring Web and Webflux support
- Sensible defaults

## Modules

### FlowID

The `opentracing-flowid` module replaces the former [`zalando/tracer`](https://github.com/zalando/tracer) library by providing support for the `X-Flow-ID` header propagation on top of OpenTracing.

Go checkout out its [README](opentracing-flowid) for details. 

### JDBC

The `opentracing-jdbc` module is a direct **competitor** to [opentracing-contrib/java-jdbc](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-jdbc). 

Go checkout out its [README](opentracing-jdbc) for details. 

### Proxy

The `opentracing-proxy` module is a direct **competitor** to [opentracing-contrib/java-api-extensions](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-api-extensions). 

Go checkout out its [README](opentracing-proxy) for details. 

### Servlet Extension

The `opentracing-servlet-extension` module is an **extension** to `io.opentracing.contrib:opentracing-web-servlet-filter` and only useful if used in conjunction.

Go checkout out its [README](opentracing-servlet-extension) for details. 

### Spring Web Extension

The `opentracing-spring-web-extension` module is an **extension** to `io.opentracing.contrib:opentracing-spring-web` and only useful if used in conjunction.

Go checkout out its [README](opentracing-spring-extension/opentracing-spring-web-extension) for details. 

### Spring Webflux Extension

The `opentracing-spring-webflux-extension` module is an **extension** to `io.opentracing.contrib:opentracing-spring-web` and only useful if used in conjunction.

Go checkout out its [README](opentracing-spring-extension/opentracing-spring-webflux-extension) for details.

## Alternatives

Tracer, by design, does not provide sampling, metrics or annotations. Neither does it use the semantics of spans as
most of the following projects do. If you require any of these, you're highly encouraged to try them.
